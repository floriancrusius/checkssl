# checkssl

`checkssl` is a Node.js script that checks the expiration dates of SSL certificates for a list of domains. It can take input from the command line or from a file.

## Usage

You can provide domains directly with one or multiple `-d` option, or you can provide one or multiple file containing a list of domains with the `-f` option. If no domains or files are provided, the script will look for a file named `.checkssl` in your home directory.

Here are some examples:

```bash
# Check a single domain
checkssl -d example.com

# Check multiple domains
checkssl -d example.com -d example.org

# Check domains from a file
checkssl -f domains.txt
```

The script will output a table with the domains and their SSL certificate expiration dates, sorted in ascending order by date.

## Error Handling

If a domain is invalid or a file does not exist, the script will print an error message. You can suppress these error messages with the `-s` option.

```bash
# Suppress error messages
checkssl -d invalid -s
```

## Exit Codes

The script will exit with a code of 0 if it runs successfully, or 1 if it encounters an error.

## Dependencies

This script uses the built-in `https`, `fs`, `os`, and `path` modules in Node.js, so no additional installation is required.

## Code

Here is the main script:

```javascript
// The code goes here
```

You can copy the above markdown and paste it into your README or any markdown file. Replace `// The code goes here` with the actual code.
